### 📝 About

In this project, we conducted experiments to measure and evaluate the solution and performance of OR-Tools for Knapsack problems. Our objective was to familiarize ourselves with OR-Tools, learning how to install and practically apply it. Setting up the experiments involved cloning a test-case set, reading files, and extracting data from the cloned folder. Automating these experiments efficiently posed a significant challenge.

Practically, employing solver tools to tackle optimization problems was pivotal. Utilizing multiple computers proved effective in executing experiments, and leveraging programming languages to automatically generate reports showcased intelligent automation.
