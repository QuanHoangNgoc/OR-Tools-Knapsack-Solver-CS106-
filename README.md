### about 
- In this project, we conducted some experiments to measure and evaluate the solution and performance of OR-Tools for Knapsack problems. Thus, we also learn how to use OR-Tools and install it for practical purposes. To set up the experiments, we need to clone the test-case set, read files and get data from the clone folder. Besides, how to operate the experiments in an automatic and efficient way is a challenge that we must face.
- In practical terms, we should use solver tools to solve optimization problems.
- In general, using multiple computers is an effective way to operate experiments, and using  programming language to automatically generate reports is intelligent.

- [x] OneDrive [OR-Tools_Multi-computers_Automatic-Report.ttnt](https://uithcm-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/22521178_ms_uit_edu_vn/EsZIOq2rZ9VMsY8xvEaAuyQBaI79V5Znk-6JcrjjWioqfg?e=OCb0cW)
  - This is submit files
  - Back up this project   
# Pipeline:  
- Survey the guidelines and examples, api docs for frameworks, platforms, libraries, and functions that need to use.
- Design and build a pipeline of experiments running to operate them automaticly.
- Back up and log the results of experiments into files while running and then synthesize.
- Use programming language to create long table report. 
# How to install this project: 
- Clone the ALL_PROJECT branch to see all tricks, source code, and results of experiments. 
# Donate:
