### about 
- In this project, we conducted some experiments to measure and evaluate the solution and performance of OR-Tools for Knapsack problems. Thus, we also learn how to use OR-Tools and install it for practical purposes. To set up the experiments, we need to clone the test-case set, read files and get data from the clone folder. Besides, how to operate the experiments in an automatic and efficient way is a challenge that we must face.
- In practical terms, we should use solver tools to solve optimization problems.
- In general, using multiple computers is an effective way to operate experiments, and using  programming language to automatically generate reports is intelligent.
